/**********************************************************************

	You're probably looking for some styles to get started 
	with your new copy of Devly. Let me give you the run down 
	of where to find things, and what this theme can do.
	
	Devly was built with developers in mind. It aims to make 
	life easier by taking care of tedious tasks, and simplifying the 
	work flow. It aims to help you re-use code whenever possible!
	
	
	The file sctructure:
	
	-	/assets/core/
	
		- admin.php
		
			- 	This handles most of the things going
			  	on in the admin. We remove a whole bunch
			  	of default widgets & add a couple of our
			  	own. This is where we also set up the
			  	custom login screen, and login functions.
			  
			  	Check out the comments to see what it can do!

		- core.php
		
			-	This is where all the heavy lifting
				is happening. We're cleaning up a few
				messy parts of wordpress & running some
				code for security precautions. This is
				also where all of the stylesheets and
				scripts are enqueued at.
				
				Again, check the comments.
				
		- helpers.php
		
			- 	This file consists of a lot of helper
				functions I've found myself using on most
				of my Wordpress sites. Feel free to use
				them, or delete em!
				
				The comments are a bit more detailed here!
				
		- meta.php
		
			-	This file builds a custom metabox helper
				to the Devly theme. This allows you to easily
				create custom metaboxes in the wordpress admin.
				In devly/meta-example.php, a couple of arrays
				are constructed to build out examples of 
				each metabox the helper supports
		
		- settings.php
		
			-	This file sets up the theme options you
				see in the admin. It was included in Devly
				as a "base" template, so others can use
				it as a starting point, so the information
				you enter in the settings page won't be
				reflected on the site.		
	
	
	The rest of the files are in /assets/
	
	-	assets/css/
		
		-	admin.css 		- Admin styles
		-	devly.css 		- Normalize CSS Reset
		-	global.css		- Your theme styles are here
		-	responsive.css	- Additional theme styles (responsive)	
		
	- assets/img/
	
		- img/admin			- Any image assets used in the admin
		- img/ui			- Image assets used for the theme
		
	- assets/scripts/
	
		- scripts/libs		- Any third party JS Libraries needed
		- main.js			- Theme scripts & fallsbacks
		
	- assets/type/			- I use this for font files when needed	
	
	
													-	Happy Coding
