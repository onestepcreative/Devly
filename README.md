# A Wordpress Framework for Developers

A modern Wordpress Framework, aka theme, for developers.

## About Devly

Devly was conceived more than two years ago, mostly out of frustration for having to jump around in old projects to find code that I needed for a current project. I decided to build a framework (a solid starting point) that would package up common functionalities I use on most sites, wrapping them up for easy re-use. The theme is well documented, and consists of a handy file called Helpers.php that gives you access to common functionalities with the use of a simple functions call.

## Devly Details
