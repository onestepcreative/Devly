# Devly, a Modern Wordpress Theme for Developers

A modern theme, built to give developers a solid starting point for wordpress dev.

## About Devly

Devly was conceived almost two years ago from a personal challenge to start building Wordpress Themes. The original goal was to create a framework that I could use for each of my Wordpress sites. Although the theme has evolved greatly since then, it has been a great theme to use as a starting point. I've built sites for small bed & breakfast company, all the way up to industry leading company getting millions of views a month.
